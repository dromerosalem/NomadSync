# Brainstorming Ideas

## When to use this skill
- When starting a new project or feature.
- When requirements are vague or high-level.
- Before writing any code for a major change.

## Workflow
1.  **Context Alignment**: Verify understanding of the current project state and intent.
2.  **Sequential Refinement**: Ask focused questions one by one to avoid overwhelming the user.
3.  **Sectional Design**: Present the resulting design in small chunks (200-300 words).
4.  **Continuous Validation**: Confirm alignment with the user after each section.
5.  **Finalization**: Consolidate the brainstormed details into a structured technical specification.

## Instructions
- **Stay Focused**: Do not drift into implementation details unless requested.
- **Micro-Dialogue**: Prioritize back-and-forth communication. One question per turn is the goal.
- **Visual Aids**: If helpful, suggest UI layouts or architecture diagrams (using text or drawing tools).
- **Mandatory Pre-work**: Refuse to implement broad features until a brainstorming phase is completed.
